Forked from https://github.com/HydroSense/FeatherM0_Davis_ISS_rx

Removed unneeded code

Increased accuracy (Now losing less than 5% of packets versus 90%) 

Other needed changes



Intro
-----
Source modified from [kobuki's VPTools](https://github.com/kobuki/VPTools) to run on the Adafruit Feather M0 board by Alan Marchiori.

The main modification was to poll the radio rather than use a timer because timers the M0 are not yet well supported by Arduino (and/or me).

The file FeatherM0_Davis_ISS_rx.ino is based on VPTools ISSRx sketch and shows how to receive ISS packets. I did not port the other sketches by kobuki.

Indications
-----------
Led flashing rapidly = searching for a station.
One short led flash = packet received from ISS.
Led off = in sync with all stations and currently sleeping or waiting for a packet from the ISS.

Notes
-------------
The main radio poll loop was rewritten to be polled from the arduino main loop. When in sync with all stations, the radio is put into standby when possible to save power. The radio is turned on just before a station is expected to transmit. This should help reduce power consumption on battery powered systems. However, I only have one ISS so was not able to verify this works as expected with multiple stations.

VPTools is a Davis(TM) weather station compatible transceiver library. It is a work in progress. It can receive from multiple RF transmitters (ISS, ATK, etc.) It tries to serve as a basis for similar hobby projects. Example sketches provide simple, parseable and RAW packet output among others.

* The ISSRx sketch is a receiver with a simple interface configurable in source code.
* The AnemometerTX sketch is a simple anemometer transmitter for Davis anemometers. It's a work in progress and needs optimisations for low power operation, but can serve as a base for doing so. It can easily be adapted to emulate any Davis transmitter.
* The WxReceiver sketch is a receiver compatible with the [WeeWx driver](https://github.com/matthewwall/weewx-meteostick) written by Matthew Wall et al for the Meteostick.
